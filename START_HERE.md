## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If npm install fails:
1. Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be 18+)
2. Update npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`
3. Try again: `npm install`

### If port 3001 is busy:
Edit `package.json` and change port:
```json
"dev": "next dev -p 3002"
```

### If you see errors:
- Make sure you're in the correct folder: `cd /Users/yendek/Documents/programming/prosuite-prototypes`
- Clear cache: `rm -rf .next`
- Try again: `npm run dev`
