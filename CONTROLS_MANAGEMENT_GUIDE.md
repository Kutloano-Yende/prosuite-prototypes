## üîó **Integration with Other Modules**

### **Controls ‚Üî Compliance Obligations**

**How it works:**
1. **Obligations Form** now includes "Related Controls" field
2. **Controls Form** links to "Related Regulations"
3. **Bidirectional relationship** - obligations reference controls, controls reference regulations

**Example Flow:**
```
GDPR Obligation ‚Üí Links to ‚Üí Data Encryption Control
Data Encryption Control ‚Üí Links to ‚Üí GDPR Regulation
```

### **Controls ‚Üî Risk Management**

**Integration Points:**
- Controls mitigate specific risks
- Risk assessments test control effectiveness
- Control failures create new risks

### **Controls ‚Üî Governance**

**Integration Points:**
- Controls enforce policies
- Frameworks define required controls
- Policy updates may require new controls

### **Controls ‚Üî Audit Management**

**Integration Points:**
- Audits test control effectiveness
- Control testing is part of audit procedures
- Audit findings may identify control gaps

## üéØ **Best Practices for Control Capture**

### **1. Comprehensive Consequences Documentation**

**Financial Consequences:**
```
‚úÖ Good: "Potential GDPR fines up to ‚Ç¨20M or 4% of annual turnover, cost of breach investigation and remediation"
‚ùå Poor: "Fines"
```

**Operational Consequences:**
```
‚úÖ Good: "Unauthorized access to systems, data breach and data loss, system downtime during incident response"
‚ùå Poor: "Problems"
```

### **2. Clear Control Descriptions**

**Good Example:**
```
"Perform quarterly reviews of user access to critical systems and applications to ensure appropriate access levels. Reviews include verification of current job roles, removal of terminated employee access, and validation of elevated privileges."
```

**Poor Example:**
```
"Review access"
```

### **3. Proper Evidence Documentation**

**Include:**
- Audit reports
- Test results
- Monitoring logs
- Compliance certificates
- Process documentation

### **4. Regular Review Schedule**

**Set appropriate frequencies:**
- **Critical controls:** Monthly/Quarterly
- **Standard controls:** Semi-annually
- **Low-risk controls:** Annually
